/**
 * The Playwright `WebFetchProvider`: renders one URL in a real browser and
 * returns it as markdown (denoised) or HTML. Mirrors `dsh-web-fetch-http`'s
 * error taxonomy (URL hygiene, abort/timeout translation, content-type
 * classification) so the tool layer sees the same codes from either backend.
 *
 * Lifecycle — one row per backend:
 *
 * - `local`: launches a browser per fetch and closes it; nothing outlives the
 *   call. Fresh context, fresh everything.
 * - `managed` (DSH-hosted persistent browser): launches ONE browser for the
 *   provider's lifetime over `userDataDir` (`launchPersistentContext`), so
 *   logins persist across fetches and restarts; each fetch opens a tab in that
 *   persistent context and closes only the tab. The browser and its profile
 *   context are never closed per fetch — only on plugin teardown (or when a
 *   setting that shapes the launch changes, which replaces it).
 * - `cdp`: keeps ONE shared connection to a browser someone else started; each
 *   fetch opens a page (tab) inside it and closes that on completion — in a
 *   throwaway isolated context, or (the default, `shareBrowserContext`) in the
 *   remote browser's default context so its profile, cookies, and persistent
 *   logins apply; that default context is never closed.
 *
 * Concurrency counts TABS for `cdp` and `managed` (one browser is already
 * alive; a slot is a tab) and BROWSERS for `local` — hence the backend-priced
 * defaults ({@link DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENCY_LOCAL} /
 * {@link DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENCY_CDP} / {@link DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENCY_MANAGED}).
 * Either way, an aborted signal closes the fetch's page, further fetches wait
 * briefly in a queue, and a queued fetch fails fast (rather than hanging until
 * abort) when no slot frees.
 *
 * Private-network and SSRF protection is not implemented (same stance as the
 * shipped HTTP provider); a page this provider can reach is whatever the
 * browser can reach. Profile-bearing backends (`managed`, CDP `profile` mode)
 * additionally act WITH the browser's logged-in sessions (see the README's
 * risk notes).
 *
 * Outbound proxy (P0): the proxy configured in the settings is injected into
 * every browser THIS PLUGIN launches — `local` and `managed` — through
 * Playwright's `launch({ proxy })` / `launchPersistentContext({ proxy })`;
 * with no proxy configured the key is not passed at all. A proxy is a
 * launch-time property of a browser PROCESS, so on the `cdp` backend it
 * belongs to the browser that was started elsewhere: this plugin can neither
 * inject it there nor verify it (see {@link CDP_PROXY_NOTE} and
 * {@link CDP_PROXY_POLICY}), and the local launcher turns the same settings
 * into that browser's `--proxy-server`. Every proxy failure THIS plugin can
 * observe (an unusable value, a launch that failed with a proxy configured)
 * surfaces as {@link WEB_FETCH_PROXY_CODE}, naming the proxy address and where
 * it came from — and never the password.
 *
 * Cloudflare challenges (issue #2): when a navigation lands on a challenge
 * interstitial, the fetch waits — on the SAME page and in the SAME browser
 * context, so the browser's natural verification and any clearance cookies
 * it earns apply — for a bounded, configurable window
 * (`challengeWaitMs`, default 15s; 0 restores the legacy first-response
 * behavior). The wait tracks the LAST main-frame navigation response (the
 * real page reloads in after the challenge clears) and watches the live DOM
 * so SPA-style clears are caught too. It never clicks, never injects
 * answers, never touches cookies itself; when the budget runs out the fetch
 * fails with {@link WEB_FETCH_CHALLENGE_CODE} instead of returning the
 * interstitial as content.
